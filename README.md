# AutoLLM
A UI based LLM fine-tuning. It can fine-tune latest open-sourced LLMs on cloud instances (aws) with user defined settings, merge multiple adaptors to a single pre-trained LLM model and deploy the model with or without a RAG system synced with documents in user defined S3 bucket, either on instances with per hour pricing like aws or GCP or on instances with per API call pricing. Repo is still in infancy stage :)
